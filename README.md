# TBDetection-From-ChestXray-ML

In this project, On Tuberculosis data, we offer a machine learning technique to compare the performance of K Nearest Neighbors and an ensemble of classifiers. Real data was used to train the categorization models. We have used Local KNN, Weighted KNN and Gradient Boosting to predict the disease in patients and we have compared their accuracies and found the best for our problem. The classifiers' prediction accuracy was assessed using k-fold Cross Validation, and the results were compared to determine the best prediction accuracy.
